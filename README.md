a controlled component is one that propagate its change to parent, as well as keep the have the state in the parent set back into the component as a prop

parent to child ==> props

state under a component, when updated via the updateState function, triggered rendering of component and child

so parent keep state, state get updated by something in child, child renders with state from parent passed in as prop
